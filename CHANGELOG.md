# Changelog

All notable changes to the MMCA.Common packages are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
and are derived from git tags by MinVer (see [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md)).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Broker retry policy.** `AddBrokerMessaging` now configures `UseMessageRetry` (exponential backoff)
  on both the RabbitMQ and Azure Service Bus transports. Tunable via new `MessageBus:RetryLimit`,
  `MessageBus:RetryMinIntervalSeconds`, and `MessageBus:RetryMaxIntervalSeconds` settings.
- **`IAnonymizable`** erasure seam (`MMCA.Common.Domain`) for reconciling soft-delete with
  data-subject erasure requests. See ADR-005.
- **`OutboxCleanupService`** background service that purges processed outbox rows. New settings
  `Outbox:RetentionDays` (default 7) and `Outbox:CleanupIntervalHours` (default 6).
- **bUnit** component-test harness for the shared Blazor UI primitives.
- **`MMCA.Common.Testing.UI`** package — shared bUnit component-test infrastructure: a unified
  MudBlazor/auth-aware test base (`BunitComponentTestBase`), a dialog/popover/snackbar provider
  harness, and interaction helpers. Consumed by downstream apps so component tests stop duplicating
  the bUnit/auth setup. This brings the published set to **twelve** packages.
- **Outbox dead-letter metric** is now exported (`AddMeter("MMCA.Common.Outbox")`).
- Supply-chain hardening: NuGet lock files, package source mapping, dependency vulnerability
  auditing, an SBOM at release, and Dependabot.
- `SECURITY.md`, `VERSIONING.md`, and a published breaking-change policy.

### Changed
- **(Behavior)** Processed outbox rows are now purged after `Outbox:RetentionDays` (default **7 days**).
  Previously they were retained indefinitely. Set `Outbox:RetentionDays = 0` to restore the old behavior.

### Fixed
- `IntegrationEventConsumer` no longer claims (in a comment/log) a retry policy that was never
  configured — a real retry policy is now applied (see Added).

### Security
- Dependency vulnerability audit is enforced in CI (`dotnet list package --vulnerable`), and
  `nuget.config` restricts each package to its expected source via `packageSourceMapping`.
